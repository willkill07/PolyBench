	* utilities/makefile-gen.pl: Fixed a bug in Makefile generation where
	EXTRA_FLAGS was not used. Reported by Willy Wolff <willy.mh.wolff@gmail.com>.
	* gemver: Fixed the definition of x in gemver; was missing a transpose. The
	C implementation was correct but the R version and the pdf was not.
	* syr2k: This kernel was doing twice the work due to missing constraint on
	j loop. It did not affect the output due to symmetry.
	* gemm,gesummv,syrk,syr2k,2mm,3mm: Updated the input generation to avoid
	some zeros in the output.
	* trisolv: Fixed the R implementation that was not working due to a typo.
